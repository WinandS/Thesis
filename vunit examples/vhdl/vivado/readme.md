# Vivado and VUnit example
## Purpose
The purpose of this example is to show an example of how compilation
and behavioral simulation of Vivado IPs can be performed in a VUnit
project. In this example a simple Vivado project with a single fifo IP
is generated by a script. The Vivado project is generated just to have
a project for the example and is beside the point. The user can
substitute his or her manually created or generated project.

**NOTE:** Besides compiling the Vivado IP the unisim library is also
compiled since it required by the IP used in this example. The user
can remove the compile of the unisim library and substitute with his
or her precompiled unisim library. Some Vivado IP:s might require more
Xilinx libraries such as secureip and the user must then modify the
example to ensure that this and other libraries are added during the
IP compile.

Tested with Vivado 2014.3 on a Linux machine.

## Running
```shell
python generate_vivado_project.py
python run.py
```
