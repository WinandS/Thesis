\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
In the summer of 2015 I had the chance to start an internship for four weeks. The only problem was: I had to find a company that was willing to accept an intern, by myself. I was lucky to get the help of prof. Luc Colman who introduced me to the company Sigasi. They offered me an internship where I would write unit tests for software they were developing. After a very interesting month, where I learned a lot, they offered me an even more interesting project. They were prepared to guide me during my masters thesis and proposed the topic discussed in this report. I was happy to accept and am very grateful for the opportunity they have given me. For this, and for their support and guidance during my graduation year I would like to thank the people of Sigasi nv, especially my supervisors dr. ir. Hendrik Eeckhaut and dr. ir. Lieven Lemiengre.

I would also like to thank professor Luc Colman for providing me with feedback and practical information. Also I am grateful to everyone who has helped me by proof reading this report.
