\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
In the summer of 2015 I had the chance to start an internship for four weeks. The only problem was: I had to find a company that was willing to accept an intern by myself. It is then that I, through my promoter prof. Luc Colman, found and contacted Sigasi nv. They offered me an internship where I would write unit tests for software they were developing. After a very interesting month where I learned a lot, they made me an even more interesting offer. They were prepared to guide me during my masters thesis and proposed the topic discussed in this report. I was happy to accept and am very grateful for the opportunity they have given me. For this, and for their support and guidance during my graduation year I would like to thank the people of Sigasi nv, especially my supervisors dr. ir. Hendrik Eeckhaut and dr. ir. Lieven Lemiengre.

I would also like to thank professor Luc Colman for providing me with feedback and practical information. Also I am grateful to everyone who has helped me by proof reading this report.
